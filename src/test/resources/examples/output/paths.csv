#lines starting with # should be ignored
#one file can have multiple paths
#Every path should be numbered, for first path use three digits e.g. 001, where NUMBER should be replaced by 001
#The total distance for each path should be given in m rounded to the unit e.g. 1521, where TOTAL_DISTANCE should be replaced by 1521
#The total energy for each path should be given in kWh, rounded to two decimal places e.g. 0.37, where TOTAL_ENERGY should be replaced by 0.37
#The elevation difference between the first and last point in m, rounded to the unit e.g. -10 or 10, where ELEVATION should be replaced by -10 or 10
#latitudeA;longitudeA - one line for each point/park on the path
